# TODO

This is quick TODO list for me for my next steps. This does not guarantee that it will be done soon (or ever). It's mostly for personal reference and notes to self.

## [ ] GC

## [ ] Memory Allocator

## [ ] Object wrapper to convert from and to c structs 

c -> P# : It needs the structure definition to define an appropriate Class prototype with the same fields. It needs to be recursive for the properties!

## [ ] Object wrapper to convert from and to c++ classes?

## [ ] String object implementation & methods

## [ ] Default builtin functions like print, 

## [ ] Array splicing?

## [ ] Copy operator
